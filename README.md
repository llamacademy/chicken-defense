# Chicken Defense

Save your chickens from sneaky snakes and fiendish foxes! Hosted free on [Itch.io page](https://llamacademy.itch.io/chicken-defense)

Chickens will automatically spawn periodically. Obviously, chickens lay eggs. Use the eggs to spawn Llamas to defend the chickens! If all your chickens are eaten by foxes, you lose! Foxes only target chickens, snakes only target eggs.

This microgame was created as a means to show and teach how different aspects of a game can be created. See the [Challenges](./Challenges.md) for some challenges to test your understanding!
